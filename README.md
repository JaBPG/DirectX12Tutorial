This is the repo for my DirectX12 beginners tutorial video series featured on youtube. If you want to download the sourcecode for a specific part of the youtube series check the older commits.

It's possible to find the commits starting with episode 4 (we started doing DXGI in that episode).

The code is provided as is with no warranty of any kind. It's not copyrighted and can be used as you see fit as is or in an altered state. References are appreciated but not mandatory.
